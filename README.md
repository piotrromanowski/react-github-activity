# react-github-activity-mobile

A React based github-activity component for **MOBILE**.

Inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/caseyscarborough/github-activity) and [this repo that extended it further](https://github.com/piotrromanowski/react-github-activity). I wanted to develop a github activity component that was much simpler to setup in a react project, and which was ALSO responsive to different **MOBILE DEVICE** sizes..

It is recommended to pass the client ID and Secret when using the github API to prevent encountering the limit. learn more [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/#oauth2-keysecret)

## Demo

See the project in action on [my website](https://davidplopez.com)
